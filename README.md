As a dedicated cybersecurity professional specializing in code analysis, compliance management, threat modeling, and security training, I bring a holistic approach to securing organizational assets. With extensive experience utilizing tools like Snyk, OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, and WhiteSource, I conduct thorough static and dynamic code analyses to identify vulnerabilities and ensure code quality.

In the realm of compliance management, I have a proven track record of monitoring and upholding industry standards such as GDPR, PCI-DSS, SOC2, ISO 27001, and NIST. My expertise includes policy development, conducting internal and external audits, and generating insightful compliance reports using platforms like Splunk and the ELK Stack.

My threat modeling proficiency involves leveraging methodologies like STRIDE and DREAD, as well as frameworks like Mitre ATT&CK and OWASP Top Ten, to proactively identify and mitigate potential security threats. Through penetration testing and red teaming exercises, I validate threat models and enhance organizational security postures.

Passionate about fostering a culture of security awareness, I develop and deliver comprehensive training programs tailored to various roles within an organization. By conducting workshops, webinars, and e-learning sessions, I empower teams to adopt best practices and stay vigilant against emerging threats.

What sets me apart is my integrated approach to cybersecurity—bridging technical expertise with effective communication to not only secure systems but also educate and empower teams. Currently, I'm working on three exciting projects that further advance security measures—stay tuned for updates!

I'm eager to connect with professionals and organizations committed to building a more secure digital landscape. Feel free to reach out to discuss how we can collaborate to enhance cybersecurity initiatives.
