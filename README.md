Hey there! 🤩 What's up? I'm your friendly neighborhood Data Analyst extraordinaire, but you can call me the Data Magician! ✨🎩

Picture this: I'm like a wizard with a blend of Python, Excel, R, Google Data Studio, and SAL sorcery in my arsenal. I'll analyze data faster than you can say "Abracadabra!" 🧙‍♂️

But hold on, there's more! I'm not just a master of data manipulation; I'm also a wizard of development! With my React Native and React JS spells, combined with Python's enchanting Numpy and Django, I'll craft the most magical Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) you've ever seen! 🌟💻 And guess what? My HTML, CSS, JS FBP, C#, and C++ incantations will turn your web projects into pure wizardry!

Need some enchanting designs? Fear not! I'm an expert in the art of Figma prototyping. I'll weave captivating user interfaces that will leave everyone spellbound! ✨🎨

Oh, and did I mention my project management skills? I'm like a Jira genie, an Asana sorcerer, and a Trello trickster all in one! I'll keep everything organized and running smoother than a broomstick race at Hogwarts! 🧹✨

Now, brace yourself, for I have access to the magical realms of Cloud! With AWS, GCP, Azure, and IBM Cloud, I can summon computational power like summoning a phoenix! 🌩️🌈

As if that's not enough, I've got a secret potion to access the realm of databases! SQL, MySQL, and PostgreSQL are no match for my database wizardry! I'll charm your data to reveal its deepest secrets! 🔍💾

So, fellow adventurers, I'm on a quest for an internship where I can put my spellbinding skills to work. And let me tell you, I'll be doing it all with the charismatic charm and humor of Kevin Hart! Get ready for a data journey filled with laughter and learning! 🤣📈

Join me on this magical ride, and together, we'll conquer the world of data analytics, one hilarious query at a time! 🌟🔮 Let's make the data dance to the rhythm of laughter! 🎉💃
